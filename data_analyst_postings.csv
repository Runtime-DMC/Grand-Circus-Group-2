We advise and support our partners in their efforts to plan and execute successful, data-driven electoral, organizing, and advocacy campaigns so that together we can transform the politics of education. And, we build political influence, craft strategies, leverage data and develop technology that enable our partners to accelerate progress, particularly those in traditionally marginalized communities.Who We AreOur team includes experts and innovators in data, analytics, and strategy. We are former teachers, organizers, data scientists, nonprofit executives, political campaign veterans, and more - and we are looking for people whose passion and expertise can help improve our work and realize our vision.BackgroundMurmuration’s role is to support organizations and communities through our political systems, to raise the profile of the issue of public education such that more Americans will prioritize the needs of our students, and to leverage politics to help to create the broader context in which those on the front lines with our children can thrive. We are focused on transforming the politics of education - partnering with organizations across the country committed to organizing parents and communities around the issues of public education and educational equity, electing to office and holding accountable local leaders who will make improving public K-12 schools a priority, and advocating for policy changes with the goal of improving outcomes for children. To do this, we believe that it is critical that all of the political stakeholders- electoral organizations, advocacy and organizing groups, charter associations, networks of schools, districts, elected officials, and voters - to contribute to a strong and politically savvy education sector that works together toward a common vision of improving public education.About the PositionThe Data Analyst has two main responsibilities. First, the Data Analyst will listen to our partners and staff to understand the questions and problems they have that can be answered with data. Second, the Data Analyst will source the answers and solutions to those questions and problems and present them in a clean, concise way for both technical and non-technical audiences to understand. To do this you must be a creative multi-disciplinarian who can work effectively with all parts of the organization- from analyzing and visualizing the data with the data scientists, to sourcing new data with the data managers and data engineers, and then discussing the output with our partnership success managers. If you are interested in learning more about data, education, or politics, this is a great chance to gain hands-on experience with a small but quickly growing organization.Note: At Murmuration, we are committed to becoming an even more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. To this end, all staff members are expected to sit on and actively participate in DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) subcommittees. These subcommittees work to ensure that DEI is embedded in everything we do.The Data Analyst will:Be a member of the Data Science Team and conduct exploratory data analyses on a variety of datasets including internal polling data, campaign outreach data, and voterfile informationWork with each part of the Murmuration team to identify internal reports that could improve the output of our data science productsCreate analytic reports, graphs, and dashboards for Murmuration and for partners answering their key questionsBe conversant in basic statistics and be able to perform our most common analytic operations using tools such as Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel, etc.Learn to work collaboratively in a technical environment with the goal of building tools that are constantly evolving based on our needsBecome an expert in data visualization solutions and learn when and where to apply each solutionWork with the Data Team to craft data acquisition strategy for any key data we are missing that lets us address the above questions and problemsCandidate ProfileThe Data and Data Science teams are highly collaborative, friendly and hard-working, and we are looking for a Data Analyst who embodies those values.The ideal candidate is:Data-drivenCreativeFlexibleA self-starterA constant learnerA problem-solverAn effective communicatorTeam-oriented and collaborativeAble to multitask and prioritize work effectivelyResponsible and able to meet deadlinesPassionate about education and/or politics (or interested in learning more)The ideal candidate will have a background/studies in political science, sociology, mathematics, statistics, education or other related field.We are relying on you to be our translator, storyteller, and problem solver. You should always be listening and reading between the lines to try and identify problems our partners and staff are having, which are often different from the problems they are describing. You are comfortable being highly reactive to solving the questions of today while also proactively keeping an eye on longer-term questions of strategic interest. We don’t expect you to solve every problem, but you should be able to identify them, and then work with the rest of Murmuration to craft a solution. You will need to walk the fine line of knowing enough of the technical details of our solutions to be factually correct without spending so much time on it that it detracts from the primary goal of presenting these solutions as clearly and cleanly as possible.Location, Compensation, and BenefitsThe Data Analyst is a full-time, salaried position with a comprehensive benefits package. It is based anywhere in the U.S., with location preferred in New York City. Compensation for this position is commensurate with experience.An Equal-Opportunity Employer with a Commitment to DiversityMurmuration is proud to be an equal opportunity employer, and as an organization committed to diversity and the perspective of all voices, we consider applicants equally of race, gender, color, sexual orientation, religion, marital status, disability, political affiliation and national origin.

Diversity means recognizing that different views and experiences are as important as those we’re already familiar with. It means taking radical ownership of the things we affect as individuals and as a company - including even inherited ways of doing things which may be destructive or biased and which we must work to change. It means looking at the world and making sure we embody as many of its best qualities as we can, and striving for that as a matter of principle, not as a marketing goal we check off a list.Diversity goes beyond what we look like, who we are, who we love or how we think. Diversity is shorthand for an integrity-driven way of operating and growing every single day, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.If you are interested, send us your resume to jobs@magiclinks.com"
