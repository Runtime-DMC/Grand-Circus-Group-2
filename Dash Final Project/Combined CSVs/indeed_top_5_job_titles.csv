If the work diminishes agency, we may simply decide to ""eff"" it after all. In our Venice CA office and our respective domiciles live a team of highly-skilled developers, data scientists, and dubiously-lucid humorists building agency-increasing products you may recall from such sentences as the one in this paragraph. We've worked with Samsung, Walmart, Berkshire Hathaway, and other large, important entities you've probably heard of. Our work environment is fantastic for aspiring coders, calculators, and entrepreneurs. Also, we have neither VC, nor PE, nor other acronyms funding us. We have a weird business model where we sell our work for a profit and use those profits to pay people (I told you it was weird!).
More specifically, we deploy the proceeds from our consulting work in development and data science to support and incubate internal skunkworks projects (anything interesting you're working on right now?). The proceeds from those projects (we just sold one!) are used to fund cutting-edge brain-computer-interface (BCI) research - maximizing human agency before some corporate megalomaniacs interrupt our thoughts with advertisements!
Do you have strong problem-solving skills? Do you have a disposition suited for self-management? Have you ever composed a Gilbert and Sullivan parody that would offend Victorian sensibilities? If you can say ""yes"" to two of those three questions, please !
ABOUT YOU
Fluency in Python-used often, derided occasionally, and considered its eponymous reference to the best of British sketch comedy
Proven data science experience-primary or equal contributor, multiple smaller projects, management of steak-holders (so projects come out ""well-done')
Comfort with the statistics and methods deployed in classification problems-that is, the ability to see the random forest for the trees
Familiarity with NLP/NLU-even if this posting's language is a bit unnatural, we suspect you'll understand our process
Experience with image classification-pictures are worth ~1,000 lines of code, according to a bastardization of Ibsen and Brisbane
Experience calling machine learning APIs via REST or client libraries - and determining that their responses lack wit, guile, and tact
Agile experience (worked with Kanban, Scrum, Extreme Programming)-or a sound literary understanding of Steve Martin's ""Picasso at the Lapin Agile,"" even if you don't speak French
Growth mindset - You had better be funnier after the first 90 days...
Willingness to learn our systems (wait, we have systems?)
Full-time availability-but if you have cool side projects that increase human agency, we totally want you to keep working on it...we'll even help!
Demonstrated ability to work independently/autonomously
Ability to communicate effectively and work exclusively in English. This is a must, our ability to crack jokes in other languages is decidedly de rigeur...
BONUS POINTS FOR
Experience with self-managed data science projects-show us your cool side hustles, especially if they increase human agency or include obscure references!
Software development background - We need help with syntax in English too...
Experience building and training image classifier models-extra double-secret bonus points for identifying Schroedinger's cat in a video
JavaScript / Node.js experience-require(""sense of humor')
Clean Code, Unit Tests, Lather, Rinse, Repeat
Experience managing clients and client relationships-because, y'know, they pay us...
Experience in Startups-because, y'know, we kinda are one, or actually more like several startups all rolled into one!
Equity
Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you'd be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.
At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it's priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you'd want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you'd be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.
Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE's margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we're competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.
We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.
Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else's), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.
Salary range from $120k/year to $220k/year. Not in the range? That's fine, you can still and our team may fit you in a more senior position that we're not actively hiring right now, but we are growing fast and may have other openings soon.

103,Data Scientist,Ntropy Network,New York,NY,Remote,"130,000.00","130,000.00",,"$130,000.00 ",yearly,"Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out ""pats on the back"". Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn't exist yet, we will build it.
- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).

As an early member of our data science team, you will help
- push the limits of what can be done with data.
- build the team and drive the direction of the company.
- shape our product and culture.
- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people's financial lives.

The following are required

Starting in rural America. Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.
Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we're rearchitecting the way it's delivered - leveraging breakthroughs in diagnostics, remote monitoring, and a variety of other domains, Homeward is creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality.
Most importantly, we're aligning everyone's incentives (ours, partner health plans', and members') towards getting and keeping people healthy by taking full responsibility and financial risk for the total cost of each member's healthcare and outcomes.
Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo's products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding. With this leadership team and funding, Homeward is committed to bringing high-quality healthcare to rural communities in need.
The Opportunity

Join us in tackling healthcare for rural America! We're seeking a Data Scientist who is passionate about having a positive societal impact and using technology for good - solving issues of health inequity for communities that have been perennially underserved.

As an early hire, you'll be a strong well rounded resource in the analytics space - dig into business intelligence and reporting, deeper-dive analytics, and support predictive modeling, leveraging your proven track record for success in healthcare analytics.

What You'll Do
Identify needs and deliver analytics and data science products - from business intelligence to analytics to predictive modeling
Develop, mature, and deliver our business intelligence strategy across the enterprise, across growth, clinical delivery, quality, and cost results for internal and external audiences
Collaborate with stakeholders to identify highest-priority research questions, analyze relevant data, and generate actionable insights that enable improvement
Develop, design, and evaluate tests, spanning valid experimental or test design, identifying appropriate sample size, and conducting aligned statistical analysis
Develop systems and processes to use our data effectively, accurately, and efficiently across the enterprise
Collaborate with our Technology team to deliver requirements on the highest priority data sources and most appropriate structures for analytics
Support and enable predictive modeling across growth and clinical delivery domains


What You Bring
3+ years of experience in data analysis and/or business intelligence development
Demonstrated orientation toward ensuring data quality and accuracy on a case-by-case basis and at scale
Strong technical skills necessary to perform advanced analytics: coding (e.g., R, Python, Scala) and experience with data management and visualization tools (e.g. SQL, Tableau, Looker)
Collaborative spirit and ability to drive analyses with technical and non-technical stakeholders
The ability to zoom in with attention to detail and with a focus on big-picture change
Strong communicator of questions, challenges, opportunities, and results to technical and non-technical audiences


Bonus Points
Experience with EHR, claims, data, and value-based care analytics
Experience with marketing measurement, attribution, forecasting, and experimental test design and evaluation
Experience performing machine-learned analysis with large datasets
Previous experience building from the ground up on a small, fast-paced team
What Shapes Our Company
Deep commitment to one another, the people and communities we serve, and to care that enables everyone to achieve their best health
Compassion and empathy
Curiosity and an eagerness to listen
Drive to deliver high-quality experiences, clinical care, and cost-effectiveness
Strong focus on the sustainability of our business and scalability of our services to maximize our reach and impact
Nurturing a diverse workforce with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and points of view

About Harvest
Harvest is an industry-leading, independent software company that makes tools to help businesses run more smoothly. We believe that businesses only succeed by using their time intentionally. Our products support our customers through time tracking, reporting, and forecasting features.
Harvest started in 2006 as a team of three and has grown to today's current team of almost 90 with Harvesters working from around the globe. We've worked as a remote team since the beginning and we continue to hire the right people for the job no matter where they call home.
We strive to create a workplace culture where everyone feels valued, included, and heard. One important aspect of this is continuing to create spaces for diverse life experiences and work histories. If you are a member of a group that is historically underrepresented and disadvantaged in tech, business, and society in general, we want to meet you and we encourage you to apply.
Why We're Hiring
We are looking for a Data Analyst to uplevel Harves's business and product insights, developing reporting and data visualizations that inform strategic decisions throughout the entire Harvest organization.
In this role, you will leverage your technical skills to synthesize and analyze data, then present your findings via clear and consumable reporting that ensures understanding and elevates data literacy.
To be successful in this role, you must be an exceptional communicator, capable of translating complex ideas into actionable insights and presenting to all levels of the organization. You must have strong technical abilities, with expertise in SQL, Python and R combined with strong analytical skills.


What You'll Do:
Collaborate with internal stakeholders to establish KPIs and develop clear, consumable reporting. Help partners flesh out their questions, diving deeper and presenting your findings to them at the appropriate level of granularity and detail.
Synthesize data from a variety of sources to develop and present reporting and data visualizations that drive understanding and inform action for Harvesters at every level of the organization.
Leverage your extensive SQL knowledge to query and analyze data; when more advanced analysis is required, use Python or R to explore, visualize and analyze data while codifying business logic using DBT (Data Build Tool) and automating reports using Mode, our BI tool of choice.
Cultivate a nuanced understanding of Harves's data and lead research to uncover the questions we don't know we should be asking, both for our business and product.
Improve our data systems by collaborating with colleagues across Harvest to continue to expand and centralize our knowledge into DBT while ensuring stakeholders understand how to access this knowledge.
Requirements
Appetite and effort to stay up to date on the latest trends
Strong attention to detail with an analytical mind to problem-solve
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
Proven ability to visualize data in a way that increases understanding
Ability to work independently with minimal supervision while delivering results
Fluency in SQL and an added benefit if comfortable with a scripting language (preference for Python/R)
Benefits
At Harvest, our compensation consists of three main components:
A competitive base pay: The salary for this role is $165,000 in USD. Every Harvester with the same role expectations receives the same base pay. And we aim to pay at the top of the market (informed by third-party data) for all roles.
Individual and company performance bonus plans: We believe in rewarding performance, so all Harvesters are eligible to receive an individual and company performance bonus after working with Harvest for a period of time.
Competitive benefits*: We offer a number of benefits, including
15 days of vacation in your first year, plus company holidays and a week off for winter break. And you'll get an additional two days per year until you reach twenty days.
100% coverage of health insurance premiums across our medical, dental, and vision plan offerings for you, your spouse, and your dependents
A yearly budget for your professional learning and development goals
401k plan with a 6% company match after three months with the company
16 weeks of paid family leave to all new parents with the option to use it all at once or throughout the baby's first year as well as a virtual platform providing support across fertility, pregnancy, adoption, and through your first year of parenting
A charitable giving matching program to support your contributions to your favorite charitable organizations
And much more...
Some of the benefits described are only available to U.S.-based Harvesters. Benefits information for non-U.S.-based Harvesters will be provided to individuals who interview for those roles.","['SQL', 'Python']",Indeed.com

Company Description
GovDocs serves companies in building and executing their employment law compliance programs in two primary ways:
Employment Law Posting Service: We manage all the complexities of identifying and providing the required set of employment law postings from the 1,700+ potential postings across the U.S. and Canada. Using proprietary technology, we allow companies to manage, track and verify postings at each of their locations - including our patent pending PosterCheck technology. Our Employment Law Posting Update service is used by almost 22% of the Fortune 500 and 30% of the Fortune 100.
Employment Law Compliance Software Solutions: This is a first to market Software-as-a-Service starting with our Minimum Wage product and Paid Leave products, which allow companies to identify and track which laws apply to their locations and employees, then provides all relevant data to make decisions. This service was created in response to requests from some of our largest customers who recognized that employment law expansion across and variances between jurisdictions (Federal, State and Local) were too difficult to manually track.
GovDocs has grown revenue annually by 18% since 2008 with a 96% customer retention rate, primarily due to our Postings Update Program both obtaining and retaining customers - as employment law postings are required by law, every company has an existing provider. Our Software Solutions are an entirely new line of business that gives us great growth potential to create a full Employment Law Compliance (ELC) platform of solutions, it is also challenging us to reinvent how we view urgency, innovation and teamwork.
